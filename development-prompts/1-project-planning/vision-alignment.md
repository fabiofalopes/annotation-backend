# Vision Alignment Prompt

## Context
This prompt helps align the annotation platform's vision with technical implementation, focusing on creating a clear path from high-level goals to concrete technical decisions.

## Prompt Template
```
Help me analyze and refine the technical vision for my annotation platform:

1. Current State Analysis:
   - Review the existing codebase structure
   - Identify implemented vs planned features
   - Evaluate technical debt and architecture decisions
   - Assess current limitations and bottlenecks

2. Vision Requirements:
   - Data format handling (CSV, JSON, etc.)
   - Dynamic endpoint capabilities
   - UI modularity and extensibility
   - API-first design principles
   - Security and authentication needs

3. Technical Alignment:
   - Map high-level goals to technical components
   - Identify potential technical challenges
   - Suggest architectural improvements
   - Define concrete success metrics

4. Implementation Strategy:
   - Break down large features into manageable chunks
   - Prioritize core functionality
   - Plan for iterative development
   - Define technical milestones

Please provide:
- A refined technical vision document
- Component interaction diagram
- Success metrics for each major component
- Identified technical challenges and mitigation strategies
```

## Usage Guidelines
1. Use this prompt when starting new major features
2. Update it as the project evolves
3. Reference it during architectural decisions
4. Share with new team members for orientation
