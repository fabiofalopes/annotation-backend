# Development Pipeline Usage Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to effectively use our development pipelines for the annotation platform, focusing on LLM-driven development and sandbox testing approach.

## Available Pipelines

1. **Feature Development Pipeline**
   - Purpose: Develop new features from scratch
   - Key Focus: API-first design with sandbox testing
   - Main File: `feature-development-template.md`

2. **API Enhancement Pipeline**
   - Purpose: Improve existing endpoints
   - Key Focus: Performance and usability
   - Main File: `api-enhancement-template.md`

## Core Development Philosophy

1. **API-First Development**
   ```
   1. Design endpoints through actual usage needs
   2. Test in isolated environments
   3. Validate through real interactions
   4. Improve based on usage findings
   ```

2. **Sandbox Testing**
   ```
   1. Create isolated Streamlit components
   2. Test single endpoint thoroughly
   3. Document issues immediately
   4. Iterate based on findings
   ```

3. **LLM Interaction**
   ```
   1. Use structured prompts
   2. Maintain context between steps
   3. Document all interactions
   4. Learn from responses
   ```

## Using Pipelines with LLMs

### 1. Starting a Pipeline
```
1. Choose appropriate pipeline template
2. Review project-reality.md for context
3. Prepare initial requirements
4. Start with first pipeline step
```

### 2. Maintaining Context
```
1. Document each step's output
2. Reference previous steps in prompts
3. Keep track of decisions
4. Update documentation continuously
```

### 3. Handling LLM Responses
```
1. Validate against requirements
2. Test suggested implementations
3. Document findings
4. Update approach based on results
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Pipeline Selection
- Use Feature Development for new functionality
- Use API Enhancement for improvements
- Combine pipelines when needed
- Adapt steps to specific needs

### 2. Context Management
- Keep clear documentation
- Reference specific prompt sections
- Track decisions and changes
- Maintain development history

### 3. Testing Approach
- Create focused test components
- Test one thing at a time
- Document all findings
- Update tests continuously

### 4. Documentation
- Document LLM interactions
- Record implementation decisions
- Track improvement suggestions
- Update prompt templates

## Common Scenarios

### 1. New Feature Development
```
Step 1: Project Reality Check
- Use project-reality.md
- Validate feature fit
- Identify requirements

Step 2: Feature Pipeline
- Follow feature-development-template.md
- Create sandbox tests
- Implement incrementally
- Validate thoroughly
```

### 2. API Improvement
```
Step 1: Current State Analysis
- Use endpoint-review.md
- Document issues
- Identify patterns

Step 2: Enhancement Pipeline
- Follow api-enhancement-template.md
- Test improvements
- Validate changes
- Document results
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Unclear Requirements
```
1. Return to project-reality.md
2. Validate against project goals
3. Create minimal test case
4. Document findings
```

### 2. Integration Issues
```
1. Review endpoint-review.md
2. Create integration tests
3. Document dependencies
4. Test thoroughly
```

### 3. Performance Problems
```
1. Use sandbox testing
2. Measure baseline
3. Test improvements
4. Document results
```
